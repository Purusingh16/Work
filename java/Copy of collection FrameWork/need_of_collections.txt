An array is an indexed Collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.
The main advantage of Array is we can represent multiple values with a single variable.
So that reusability of the code will be improved.

Limitations of Object type Arrays:
Array are fixed in size i.e once we created an array with some size there is no 
chance of increasing or decreasing it's size based on our requirement.Hence to use 
arrays compulsary we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.

2.Array can hold only homogeneous data elements.
Ex:-
Student[] s=new Student[10000];
s[0]=new Student();(correct)
s[1]=new Customer();(wrong)

But we can resolve this problems by using Object Arrays.
Object[] o=new Object[10000];
o[0]=new Student();(correct)
o[1]=new Customer();(correct)

Array concept is not implemented based on some standered data structure 
hence readymade method support is not available for every requirement we have to write
the code explicitly.which is complexity of programing. 

To overcome the above limitations of array we should go for collections.
1.Collection are growable in nature i.e Based on our requirement we can increase(or)
Decrease the size.
2.Collection can hold both homogeneous & Heterogenous elements.
3.Every collection class is implemented based on some standered data structure.hence 
readymade method support is available for requirement.Being a programmer we have to 
use this method and we are not responsible to provide implementation. 


Difference between Array & Collections:
------------------------------------------

	Arrays
--------------------------										
1.Array are fixed in size.					
											
2.Wrt memory array are not 
recommended to use.

3.Wrt performance Array are recommended
to use.

4.Array can hold homogeneous datatypes.

5.There is no underlying data structure
for arrays and hence readymade method
support is not available.

5.Array can hold both primitives and 
object tpes.

Collection
--------------------------------------
1.Collection are growable in nature.i.e
based on our requirement we can increase
or decrease the size.
											
2.Wrt memory collection are  
recommended to use.

3.Wrt performance Collection not are recommended
to use.

4.Collection can hold both homogeneous & heterogeneous elements.

5.collection can hold only objects but not primitives.

what is collection?
--------------------
If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then 
we should go for Collection.

what is Collection framework?
-----------------------------
It defines several classes and interfaces which can be used a group of objects as 
single entity.
