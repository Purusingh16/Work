String Manipulations:
--------------------------------------
to perform String operations in java,JAVA has provided the complete predefined
library in the form of the following classes:

1.java.lang.String
2.java.lang.StringBuffer
3.java.lang.StringBuilder
4.java.util.StringTokenizer

Q.what is difference between String and StringBuffer?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ans:
String class objects are immutable objects, Immutable objects are java objects,
they are not allowing modifications on  their content,if we are trying to perform 
modifications but the resultant data will not be stored back in original object,
here the resultant data will be stored by creating new object.

StringBuffer class objects are mutable objects, these objects are allowing 
modifications directly on their content.

Note: String class objects are fixed length objects,but Stringbuffer class 
objects are variable length objects.

Q.What are the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ans:
1.StringBuffer class was introduced in JDK1.0 version.
    StringBuilder class was introduced in JDK5.0 version.

2.StringBuffer is sysnchronized.
    StringBuilder is non-sysnchronized.

3.Almost all the methods of StringBuffer are synchronized methods.
    no method is sysnchronized method in StringBuilder.

4.StringBuffer is able to allow only one thread to access data.
    StringBuilder is able to allow more than one thread to access data.

5.Stringbuffer is able to follow sequential kind of execution.
    StirngBuilder is able to follow parallel kind of execution.

6.StringBuffer will increase execution time.
   StringBuilder will reduce execution time.

7.StringBuffer will reduce application performance.
    StringBuilder will improve application performance.

8.StringBuffer will give guarantee for Data Consistency.
    StringBuilder will not give guarantee for data consistency.

9.StringBufffer is threadsafe.
    StringBuilder is not threadsafe.

Q.What is StringTokenization and how it is possible to perform 
     StringTokenization in java applications?
Ans:
The process of deviding a String into no of pieces[Tokens] is called as String 
Tokenization.

EX:
String data="Durga Software Solutions";

Tokens:Durga
                Software
                 Solutions

To perform String Tokenization in java applications,JAVA has provided a 
predefined class in the form of java.util.StringTokenizer.

We will use StringTokenization in the folloeing requirements.
1.To prepare lexical Analysis or lexial analyzer components i compiler 
     constructors.
2.To convert numberic values from word representation to numeric represen
tations.
