*it is child interface of collection.

*If we want to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing then we 
should go for Queue.


Ex:before sending a mail all mail id's we have to store somewhere and in which 
order we saved in the same order mail's should be delivered (first in first out) for this
requirement Queue concept is the best choice.



NOTE:
*all the above interfaces.
(Collection,List,set,sortedset,navigableset and queue)meant for representing a 
group of individual objects.

*If we want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs then we should 
go for map Interfaces.
